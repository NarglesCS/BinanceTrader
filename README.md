# BinanceTrader
It is a algo-trading bot.

-Main.py is the script to be ran. While loop limits it to being ran for 1440 cycles. Which is dependent on the time intervals.  
-stats.py is the helper class for calculations and such to not muddy up code in main. (although i have the buy/sell conditions there.)
